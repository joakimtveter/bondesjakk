# Bondesjakk

Bondesjakk is the Norwegian name for Tic-Tac-Toe.
This game is for two players on one cumputer.
It was made in Vanilla JavaScript as my first JS project.
It is based on [this video](https://youtu.be/Y-GkMjUZsmM) from the Youtuber [WebDevSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw), [Video](https://youtu.be/Y-GkMjUZsmM).

## Future plans

I plan to make changes and possably rework this game to somthing more my visual style and add features such as timers, win counters, etc.
