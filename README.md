# Bondesjakk

Bondesjakk is the Norwegian name for Tic-Tac-Toe.
This game is for two players on one cumputer.
It was made in Vanilla JavaScript as my first JS project.
It is based on [this video](https://youtu.be/Y-GkMjUZsmM) from the Youtuber [Kyle from Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw).
